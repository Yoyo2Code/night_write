Night Writer
============
Module 1 Project
----------------
This was a project that was a twist on the Night Writer _also known as_ __sonography__. It was designed by Charles Barbier by order of Napoleon.

This twist on The Night Writer is incorporating Braille, and putting a different style format. Inside the `./lib/dictionary.rb` file is a list of the characters compatible to be used, along with the Braille output.
